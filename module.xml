	<description>
		The boss-secretary module creates a special ring group which includes
one or more "bosses" and one or more secretaries". When someone calls
the boss' extension, the secretary (or secretaries) extension will ring only, allowing the secretary to answer his or her boss' call. Only secretary ( or secretaries ) or 'thief extensions' are authorized to call directly to boss extension. With feature code you can turn on or off secretary group.
